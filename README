Done against nginx code from OpenBSD CVS.
1. Allow hostnames in "Auth-Server" header. Useful, when auth_http mission rules by nginx itself
(i.e. no external script used, see http://vgimly.blogspot.com/2009/07/nginx.html for info). If host
has few IPs pointing to various mail servers, and some is/are down, the first answered server will
be used. If you're not running recursive DNS server at localhost, don't forget to set some via
'resolver' directive. This implementation is ready for chrooted installs.
2. Add possibility of secure connections to mail backends via "Auth-Protocol" header. Supported options
are 'ssl' and 'starttls'. Other, the special keyword 'secure' might be used, indicating that any
of two is acceptable: SSL is tried first, STARTTLS second; note that this is an expiremental
feature, and some mail servers will not deal with it.
3. If proxy SSL session reuse mechanism is activated (it's so, unless you explicitly set
'proxy_ssl_session_reuse' directive to off state; it's current purpose is only to force session
reusing for mail agents, which initiate multiple sessions, one by one, via single keepalive
connections), consider of incrementing NGX_MAIL_SSL_REUSE_POOL_SIZE preproc directive's value by
some to adjust your needs. It's in ngx_mail.h. Note that 'proxy_ssl_session_reuse' will not enable
actual session reuse mechanism: for that you just need to set SSL session cache via
'ssl_session_cache' directive, see docs for mail SSL module.
